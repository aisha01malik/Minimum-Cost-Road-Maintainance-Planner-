# Minimum-Cost-Road-Maintainance-Planner
Computes the Smallest number of transformations of standard roads into super roads such that:
All cities in the country are connected by roads in such a way that it is possible to travel between any two cities and that the sum of maintenance costs of these roads is not greater than K

Our country consists of N cities and M bidirectional roads connecting them. Each road has assigned a cost of its maintenance. 
The greatest achievement is "Great administrator" who manage to have all cities in the country connected by roads in such a way that it is possible to travel between any two cities and that the sum of maintenance costs of these roads is not greater than K.
